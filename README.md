DFHack was never supposed to support older systems.
DFHack Legacy was a challenge to fully backport DFHack v0.47.04r2 to Windows XP 32bit with
compiler all the way down to version 15 (Visual Studio 2008), while retaining playability
and memory alignment, which was **completed** in 30 days (10 Aug to 09 Sep 2020).

Remaining problems:
    Untested plugins: dev, purely adventurer mode or networking plugins (22/113)
    Broken plugins: debug, testing and couple other dev plugins
    Legacy Data minor memory leaks
