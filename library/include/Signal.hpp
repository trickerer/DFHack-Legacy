/*!
 * As I couldn't figure out which signal library would be a good. Too bad all
 * signal libraries seem to be either heavy with unnecessary features or written
 * before C++11/14 have become useable targets. That seems to indicate everyone
 * is now building signal system with standard components.
 *
 * Implementation and interface is build around std::function holding delegates
 * to a function pointer or a functor. One can put there example lambda function
 * that captures this pointer from connect side. The lambda function then calls
 * the slot method of object correctly.
 *
 * It is fairly simple to change the signal signature to directly call methods
 * but internally that std::function becomes more complex. The pointer to
 * member function is problematic because multiple inheritance requires
 * adjustments to this. The lambda capture approach should be easy to use while
 * letting compiler optimize method call in the callee side.
 *
 * DFHack::Signal::Connection is an connection handle. The handle can be used to
 * disconnect and block a callback. Connection destructor will automatically
 * disconnect from the signal.
 *
 * DFHack::Signal::BlockGuard is an automatic blocked callback guard object. It
 * prevents any signals from calling the slot as long the BlockGuard object is
 * alive. Internally it replaces the callback with an empty callback and stores
 * the real callback in a member variable. Destructor then puts back the real
 * callback. This allows easily recursive BlockGuard work correctly because only
 * the first BlockGuard has the real callback.
 *
 * signal_inline_tag requires careful destruction order where all connection are
 * disconnected before signal destruction. The implementation is specifically
 * targeting places like static and singleton variables and widget hierarchies.
 * It provides data race free connect, disconnect and emit operations.
 *
 * signal_shared_tag allows a bit more freedom when destroying the Signal. It
 * adds data race safety between Connection, BlockGuard and destructor. If
 * multiple callers need access to Signal with potential of destruction of
 * original owner then callers can use Signal copy constructor to take a strong
 * reference managed by shared_ptr or weak_ptr with Signal::weak_from_this().
 * weak_from_this returns an object that forwards call directly to
 * implementation when the shared_ptr is created using Signal::lock
 *
 * \param RT return type is derived from a single signature template argument
 * \param Args Variable argument type list that is derived from a signature
 *             template argument.
 * \param tag The tag type which selects between shared_ptr managed pimpl and
 *            inline member variables.
